VEIL is a transport-agnostic, shard-native overlay for censorship-resistant public feeds and privacy-preserving delivery. This app is an Android client that connects to the VEIL network, reconstructs posts from shards, and helps relay content for subscribed channels.

Features:
- Local relay mode for private testing
- Multi-lane support (WebSocket + Bluetooth/BLE)
- Shard reconstruction with progressive UI states
- Local privacy controls and Web-of-Trust inspired prioritization
- Optional protocol inspection tools

The app does not rely on proprietary services. All network and storage functions are implemented with open-source dependencies.
