# Channel Scope + Schema Plan

Goal: close the channel-isolation gap and reduce repeated app-side feed modeling.

- [x] Add Rust `veil-core` helpers for deterministic channel-scoped namespace/tag derivation.
- [x] Add JS SDK helpers for deterministic channel-scoped namespace/tag derivation.
- [x] Add test vectors for channel namespace derivation (normalization + determinism).
- [x] Add non-normative app schema crate (`veil-schema-feed`) separate from protocol core.
- [x] Document new helpers and schema scope in SDK/Rust docs.
